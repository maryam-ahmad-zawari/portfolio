    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Every great website starts with a vision — and I turn that vision into reality with creativity, precision, and purpose. My core philosophy is <strong>client satisfaction first,</strong> which means every website I create is not only visually stunning but also highly functional and tailored to meet unique business needs.</p>
    <p>By combining <strong>creativity and technical expertise,</strong> I craft websites that deliver more than just design — they perform seamlessly across all devices, ensuring a smooth and engaging experience for every user.</p>
    <p><em>“I don’t just build websites; I build trust, credibility, and growth for businesses.”</em></p>
